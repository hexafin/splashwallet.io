				<h3>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				When you use Hexa services, we collect information sent to us through
				your computer, mobile phone, or other access device. This information
				may include your IP address, device information including, but not
				limited to, identifier, device name and type, operating system,
				location, mobile network information, and standard web log information,
				such as your browser type, traffic to and from our site, and the pages
				you accessed on our website. Hexa does not intentionally collect
				information from or about any individual who is under 13 years old.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you create an account or use Hexa services, we, or our affiliates
				vendors acting on our behalf may collect the following types of
				information:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Contact information - your name, address, phone, email, Skype ID, and
					other similar information; and
				</li>
				<li>
					Financial information - the full bank account and routing numbers
					and/or credit card numbers that you link to your Hexa Account or input
					when you use paid Hexa services. If you do not use the Hexa Conversion
					Service, you may opt out of providing this information.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you seek permissions to raise Digital Currency buy and sell limits
				associated with your Hexa Account, we may require you to provide
				additional information which we may use in collaboration with service
				providers acting on our behalf to verify your identity or address,
				and/or to manage risk. This information may include your date of birth,
				taxpayer or government identification number, a copy of your
				government-issued identification, or other personal information. We may
				also obtain information about you from third parties such as credit
				bureaus and identity verification services.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you use Hexa services, we collect information about your
				transactions and/or your other activities on our website and we may
				continuously collect information about your computer, mobile device, or
				other access device for fraud prevention purposes, to monitor for
				possible breach of your Hexa Account, and to identify any malicious
				software or other activity that may harm Hexa or its users.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information
				stored by third parties such as social media sites (such as Facebook and
				Twitter). The information we have access to varies by site and is
				controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorization.
				By associating an account managed by a third party with your Hexa
				account and authorizing Hexa to have access to this information, you
				agree that Hexa may collect, store, and use this information in
				accordance with this Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, we may collect additional information you may disclose to our
				customer support team.
			</p>
			<div>
				<h3>HOW WE USE COOKIES</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				When you access our website or content or use our application or Hexa
				services, we or companies we work with may place small data files called
				cookies or pixel tags on your computer or other device. We use these
				technologies to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Recognize you as a Hexa customer;</li>
				<li>Customize Hexa services, content, and advertising;</li>
				<li>Measure promotional effectiveness; and</li>
				<li>
					Collect information about your computer or other access device to
					mitigate risk, help prevent fraud, and promote trust and safety.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				We use both session and persistent cookies when you access our website
				or content. Session cookies expire and no longer have any effect when
				you log out of your account or close your browser. Persistent cookies
				remain on your browser until you erase them or they expire.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also use Local Shared Objects, commonly referred to as "Flash
				cookies," to help ensure that your account security is not compromised,
				to spot irregularities in behavior to help prevent fraud, and to support
				our sites and services.
			</p>
			<p>
				We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information
				stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser or
				browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of Hexa
				services. The help section of most browsers or browser add-ons provides
				instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling cookies.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may encounter Hexa cookies or pixel tags on websites that we do not
				control. For example, if you view a web page created by a third party or
				use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie or
				pixel tag placed by the web page or application. Likewise, these third
				parties may place cookies or pixel tags that are not subject to our
				control and the Hexa Privacy Policy does not cover their use.
			</p>
			<div>
				<h3>HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to
				describe information that can be associated with a specific person and
				can be used to identify that person. This Privacy Policy does not apply
				to personal information that has been anonymized so that it does not and
				cannot be used to identify a specific user. Hexa takes reasonable
				precautions, as described herein, to protect your personal information
				from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
				destruction.
			</p>
			<p>
				We store and process your personal and transactional information,
				including certain payment information, such as your encrypted bank
				account and/or routing numbers, on our computers in the United States
				and elsewhere in the world where Hexa facilities or our service
				providers are located, and we protect it by maintaining physical,
				electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable U.S.
				federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as
				firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to
				our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information
				only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job
				responsibilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				We store our customers' personal information securely throughout the
				life of the customer's Hexa Account. Hexa will retain your personal
				information for a minimum of five years or as necessary to comply with
				our legal obligations or to resolve disputes.
			</p>
			<div>
				<h3>HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you
				with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use
				your personal information to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide Hexa services and customer support you request;</li>
				<li>Process transactions and send notices about your transactions;</li>
				<li>Resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>
				<li>
					Prevent and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities,
					and/or violations of our posted user terms;
				</li>
				<li>
					Customize, measure, and improve Hexa services and the content and
					layout of our website and applications;
				</li>
				<li>
					Deliver targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional
					offers based on your communication preferences; and
				</li>
				<li>
					Verify your identity by comparing your personal information against
					third-party databases.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We will not use your personal information for purposes other than those
				purposes we have disclosed to you, without your permission. From time to
				time we may request your permission to allow us to share your personal
				information with third parties. You may opt out of having your personal
				information shared with third parties, or from allowing us to use your
				personal information for any purpose that is incompatible with the
				purposes for which we originally collected it or subsequently obtained
				your authorization. If you choose to so limit the use of your personal
				information, certain features or Hexa services may not be available to
				you.
			</p>
			<h3>HOW PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH OTHER HEXA USERS</h3>
			<p>
				If you use your Hexa Account to transfer Digital Currency in connection
				with the purchase or sale of goods or services, we or you may also
				provide the seller with your shipping address, name, and/or email to
				help complete your transaction with the seller. The seller is not
				allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless
				you have agreed to it. If an attempt to transfer Digital Currency to
				your seller fails or is later invalidated, we may also provide your
				seller with details of the unsuccessful transfer. To facilitate dispute
				resolutions, we may provide a buyer with the seller's address so that
				goods can be returned to the seller.
			</p>
			<p>
				In connection with a Digital Currency transfer between you and a third
				party, including merchants, a third party may share information about
				you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number which may
				be used to inform you that a transfer has been sent to or received from
				the third party. We may use this information in connection with such
				transfers to confirm that you are a Hexa customer, that Digital Currency
				transfers are enabled, and/or to notify you that you have received
				Digital Currency. If you request that we validate your status as a Hexa
				customer with a third party, we will do so. You may also choose to send
				Digital Currency to or request Digital Currency from an email address.
				In such cases, your user name will be displayed in an email message
				notifying the user of the designated email address of your action.
				Please note that merchants you interact with may have their own privacy
				policies, and Hexa is not responsible for their operations, including,
				but not limited to, their information practices.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you authorize one or more third-party applications to access your
				Hexa account, then information you have provided to Hexa may be shared
				with those third parties. Unless you provide further authorization,
				these third parties are not allowed to use this information for any
				purpose other than to facilitate your transactions using Hexa services.
			</p>
			<div>
				<h3>HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES</h3>
			</div>
			<p>We may share your personal information with:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Third party identity verification services in order to prevent fraud.
					This allows Hexa to confirm your identity by comparing the information
					you provide us to public records and other third party databases.
					These service providers may create derivative data based on your
					personal information that can be used solely in connection with
					provision of identity verification and fraud prevention services;
				</li>
				<li>
					Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business
					operations such as bill collection, marketing, and technology
					services. Our contracts require these service providers to only use
					your information in connection with the services they perform for us,
					and prohibit them from selling your information to anyone else;
				</li>
				<li>Financial institutions with which we partner;</li>
				<li>
					Companies or other entities that we plan to merge with or be acquired
					by. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new
					combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your
					personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in
					applicable policy;
				</li>
				<li>
					Companies or other entities that purchase Hexa assets pursuant to a
					court-approved sale under U.S. Bankruptcy law;
				</li>
				<li>Law enforcement, and officials, or other third parties when:</li>
				<li>
					We are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal
					procedure; or
				</li>
				<li>
					We believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information
					is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report
					suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our User
					Agreement; and
				</li>
				<li>Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Before Hexa shares your information with any third party that is not
				acting as an agent to perform tasks on behalf of and under the
				instructions of Hexa, Hexa will enter into a written agreement requiring
				that the third party to provide at least the same level of privacy
				protection as required hereunder.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you establish a Hexa account indirectly on a third party website or
				via a third party application, any information that you enter on that
				website or application (and not directly on a Hexa website) will be
				shared with the owner of the third party website or application and your
				information may be subject to their privacy policies.
			</p>
			<p>
				In general, we will notify you of material changes to this policy by
				updating the last updated date at the top of this page, and we will
				provide you with explicit notice of material changes as required by law.
				We recommend that you visit this page frequently to check for changes.
			</p>
			<div>
				<h3>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				You are entitled to review, correct, or amend your personal information,
				or to delete that information where it is inaccurate, and you may do so
				at any time by logging in to your account and clicking the Profile or My
				Account tab. This right shall only be limited where the burden or
				expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to
				your privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons
				other than you would be violated. If you close your Hexa account, we
				will mark your account in our database as "Closed," but will keep your
				account information in our database for a period of time described
				above. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that
				persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection
				simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if
				you close your account, your personally identifiable information will
				not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with
				third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law
				enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Privacy
				Policy.
